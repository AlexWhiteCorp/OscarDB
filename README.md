2. the function of deleting a given record or a given sub-record; when deleting a record, all of its sub-records must be deleted; (part-m, part-s)
3. the function of updating the value of a given field of a given record or a given sub-record; (update-m, update-s)
4. the function of recording and / or recording files (may need to distinguish between initial data entry and current) (insert-m, insert-s).
